Environmental Monitoring System

Real-Time Data Collection:
    Continuously collect data from various environmental sensors.
    Sensors measure parameters like air quality, temperature, humidity.
    Data is timestamped and stored for analysis and visualization.

Sensor Calibration and Maintenance:
    Regular calibration to ensure accurate data measurements.
    Automated alerts for sensor malfunctions or deviations.
    Maintenance log tracks sensor health and replacement schedules.

Data Aggregation and Fusion:
   Integrate data from multiple sensors and sources.
   Normalize data formats and resolve inconsistencies.
   Fusion algorithms combine data to derive meaningful insights.

Geospatial Visualization:
   Plot sensor data on interactive maps.
   Geofencing for region-specific monitoring and analysis.
   Heatmaps and contour plots for spatial trends visualization.

Anomaly Detection and Alerts:
   Machine learning models detect abnormal patterns in data.
   Threshold-based alerts for sudden environmental changes.
   Customizable alert notifications via email or SMS.

Historical Data Analysis:
   Analyze trends and patterns in historical data.
   Identify long-term environmental changes and correlations.
   Generate reports and visualizations for stakeholders.
