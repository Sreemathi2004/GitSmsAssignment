Bug Report #1: Sensor Data Drift

Description: Temperature sensor readings are gradually drifting higher over time.
Steps to Reproduce:
Place temperature sensor in a controlled environment.
Record temperature readings at regular intervals.
Compare readings over days or weeks.
Expected Behavior: Temperature readings should remain consistent over time.
Actual Behavior: Temperature readings show a gradual increase, indicating sensor drift.
Priority: High, as inaccurate temperature readings could impact environmental analysis.
Bug Report #2: Data Dropout in Remote Monitoring

Description: Data intermittently drops out when accessing the system remotely.
Steps to Reproduce:
Access monitoring system remotely using web or mobile app.
Monitor data streams for interruptions or delays.
Note instances where data is not displayed or updated.
Expected Behavior: Continuous and reliable access to sensor data remotely.
Actual Behavior: Data intermittently disappears or fails to update during remote access sessions.
Priority: Medium, as it affects user experience and data reliability.
Bug Report #3: Incorrect AQI Calculation

Description: Air Quality Index (AQI) calculation shows inconsistent results compared to official standards.
Steps to Reproduce:
Compare sensor readings with established AQI calculations.
Calculate AQI based on pollutant concentrations using standard formulas.
Compare calculated AQI with expected values for given pollutant levels.
Expected Behavior: AQI calculations align with recognized standards and formulas.
Actual Behavior: AQI values calculated by the system deviate from expected values, indicating a calculation error.
Priority: High, as accurate AQI calculations are crucial for public health advisories.
Bug Report #4: Inconsistent Data Timestamps

Description: Data timestamps do not match actual measurement times.
Steps to Reproduce:
Record sensor readings along with timestamps.
Compare timestamps with real-time clock or external reference.
Note any discrepancies or inconsistencies in timestamp accuracy.
Expected Behavior: Data timestamps accurately reflect the time of data acquisition.
Actual Behavior: Data timestamps show inconsistencies or drift compared to real-time clock.
Priority: Medium, as accurate timestamps are essential for data analysis and correlation.
Bug Report #5: Missing Data for Specific Sensors

Description: Data from certain sensors is missing or incomplete in the system.
Steps to Reproduce:
Review data logs for completeness across all sensors.
Identify sensors with missing or irregular data patterns.
Verify sensor connections and data transmission mechanisms.
Expected Behavior: Continuous and complete data collection from all sensors.
Actual Behavior: Data from specific sensors is missing or sporadic, leading to gaps in environmental monitoring.
Priority: High, as missing data could skew analysis and decision-making.
